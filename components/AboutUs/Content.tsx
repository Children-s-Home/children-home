          Changia was formed in 2023 in response to the founders&apos; struggle
          to find volunteering opportunities during their university&apos;s
          Community-based Learning period. Realizing the difficulty of finding
          suitable establishments, they decided to create a platform to
          facilitate community engagement. Their primary goals included
          enlisting and verifying children&apos;s homes in Nairobi, showcasing
          their needs to potential donors, and making the process of giving back
          easier for everyone. With the support of their friends, they formed a
          dedicated team and developed a comprehensive product aimed at creating
          a meaningful impact. They welcome questions, ideas, feedback, or
          simply a friendly greeting from users of their platform.
